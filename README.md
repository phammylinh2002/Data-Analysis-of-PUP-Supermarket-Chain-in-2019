## Data Source
The data from PUP Supermarket is based on the **Supermarket Sales** dataset from Kaggle, which can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales). This dataset includes sales records of a supermarket across three branches, providing insights into various aspects such as customer demographics, purchase behavior, and sales trends over time.

## Data Description

The data is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following attributes:

1. **Invoice ID**: Unique identifier for each invoice, generated by the computer.
2. **City**: The city where the supermarket branch is located.
3. **Customer Type**: Classification of customers as either Members (using a membership card) or Normal (not using a membership card).
4. **Gender**: The gender of the customer.
5. **Product Line**: General category of the product, including: Electronics, Fashion Accessories, Food and Beverages, Health and Beauty, Household and Lifestyle, Sports and Travel.
6. **Unit Price**: Price of each product (in dollars).
7. **Quantity**: Number of products purchased by the customer.
8. **Tax**: 5% VAT applied to the purchase.
9. **Total**: Total invoice amount including tax.
10. **Date**: Purchase date (data ranges from January 2019 to December 2019).
11. **Time**: Purchase time (from 10 AM to 9 PM).
12. **Payment**: Payment method used by the customer (Cash, Credit Card, Ewallet).
13. **Rating**: Customer rating of the purchase experience.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing phase involved several steps to ensure the quality and usability of the data for analysis. Below are the key preprocessing tasks I performed.

### 1. Data Consolidation
The data used for this project was sourced from a single location on Kaggle. The dataset selected is named “Supermarket Sales” and was downloaded directly from Kaggle in CSV format.

### 2. Data Cleaning
The “Supermarket Sales” dataset from Kaggle was quite clean. There were no missing values, duplicate records, or errors in the data. Therefore, no additional data cleaning steps were required.

### 3. Data Transformation
During the data transformation phase, several new attributes were created from the existing date and time data. From the `Date` column, five additional attributes were generated. Two of these attributes were split into new dimensions, which will be discussed in more detail in the Data Model section. The new attributes include:
- **Date**
- **Month**
- **Year**
- **Quarter**
- **DayofWeek**

In addition to the new categorical attributes, a numerical attribute was created to represent the revenue after tax. This column, named `revenue`, was calculated by multiplying `Unit Price` by `Quantity`.

Along with generating new data, categorical encoding was performed for columns containing categorical data. A total of eight columns were encoded. However, one column, `Branch`, was removed due to data redundancy, which will be explained in more detail in the Data Reduction section. Below are the columns that were encoded and their encoding:

- **City**
  | Original Data | Encoded Data |
  |---------------|--------------|
  | Mandalay      | MAN          |
  | Naypyitaw     | NAY          |
  | Yangon        | YAN          |

- **Customer Type**
  | Original Data | Encoded Data |
  |---------------|--------------|
  | Member        | MEM          |
  | Normal        | NOR          |

- **Gender**
  | Original Data | Encoded Data |
  |---------------|--------------|
  | Female        | F            |
  | Male          | M            |

- **Product Line**
  | Original Data         | Encoded Data |
  |-----------------------|--------------|
  | Health and Beauty     | HB           |
  | Electronic Accessories | EA          |
  | Home and Lifestyle    | HL           |
  | Sports and Travel     | ST           |
  | Fashion Accessories   | FA           |
  | Food and Beverages    | FB           |

- **Date and Time**
  Date and Time were encoded in a specific format due to their varied data ranges: “yyyymmddhhmm”. For example, a `Date` of “2019/05/01” and `Time` of “13:08” would be encoded as “201905011308”.

- **Payment**
  | Original Data | Encoded Data |
  |---------------|--------------|
  | Cash          | CA           |
  | Credit Card   | CR           |
  | E-wallet      | EW           |

### 4. Data Reduction
`Branch` was not the only column removed as mentioned earlier. In addition to `Branch`, columns `COGS` and `Gross Margin` were also removed. The `Branch` column was eliminated because its data was redundant with the `City` data; each City corresponds to a Branch and vice versa. In other words, `Branch` was essentially a coded version of `City`. Therefore, `Branch` was removed to avoid redundancy and focus on more meaningful information.

For `COGS` (Cost of Goods Sold), it was found that the data did not reflect its intended meaning. The `COGS` data was essentially the result of multiplying `Unit Price` by `Quantity`. Since `Unit Price` represents the selling price, not the cost of producing the product, `COGS` was removed.

According to Investopedia, Gross Margin = Net Sales − COGS (Bloomenthal, n.d.). Since `COGS` was removed due to incorrect data representation, `Gross Margin` was also removed. Furthermore, the `Gross Margin` column contained only a single value across 1,000 rows, indicating potential unreliability. Thus, the `Gross Margin` column was removed to ensure data quality for analysis.

## Data Model

After preprocessing the data, I imported it into PowerBI and linked the datasets to create the data model, which is visualized in the image below.
